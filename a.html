              = "https://ronney.io">
          above is an absolute URL passed.
          below is how relative URL is passed ="/element/div"
          in the root domain.
   <a href:= "/absolute and relative references/div"> Absolute_Relative<a/>
     <"An absolute URL is a complete URL that specifies the full path to a resource, 
         including the scheme (e.g., "http" or "https"), domain name or IP address, and 
         the path to the specific file or resource. An absolute URL provides all the information needed to locate a resource,
         regardless of the location from which it is being accessed. An example of an absolute URL is "https://www.example.com/path/to/resource".">
     <Relative URL>
      </"relative URL is a URL that is used to specify a path to a resources relative to the
        /the location in the displaying page. relative do not inlude the "https and http, domain IP addresses,"
          /thus only specifies on the path a file and other reiurces relative to the current displaying page."
